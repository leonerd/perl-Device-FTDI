C<Device::FTDI::I2C> - use an I<FDTI> chip to talk the I²C protocol

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This subclass of L<Device::FTDI::MPSSE> provides helpers around the basic
MPSSE to fully implement the I²C protocol.

=cut

use Device::FTDI::MPSSE qw(
    DBUS
    CLOCK_RISING CLOCK_FALLING
);

use Future::Utils qw( repeat );

use constant DEBUG => $ENV{PERL_FTDI_DEBUG} // 0;

use constant {
    I2C_SCL     => (1<<0),
    I2C_SDA_OUT => (1<<1),
    I2C_SDA_IN  => (1<<2),
};

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

=cut

=head2 new

    $i2c = Device::FTDI::I2C->new( %args )

In addition to the arguments taken by L<Device::FTDI::MPSSE/new>, this
constructor also accepts:

=over 4

=item clock_rate => INT

Sets the initial value of the bit clock rate; as per L</set_clock_rate>.

=head1 METHODS

Any of the following methods documented with a trailing C<< ->get >> call
return L<Future> instances.

=cut

=head2 set_clock_rate

    $i2c->set_clock_rate( $rate )->get

Sets the clock rate for data transfers, in units of bits per second.

=cut

sub set_clock_rate
{
    my $self = shift;
    my ( $rate ) = @_;

    $self->set_clock_divisor( ( 4E6 / $rate ) - 1 );
}

=head2 set_check_mode

    $i2c->set_check_mode( $mode )

Sets the amount of ACK checking that the module will perform. Must be one of
of the following exported constants:

    CHECK_NONE, CHECK_AT_END, CHECK_AFTER_ADDR, CHECK_EACH_BYTE

This controls how eagerly the module will check for incoming C<ACK> conditions
from the addressed I²C device. The more often the module checks, the better it
can detect error conditions from devices, but the more USB transfers it
requires and so the entire operation will take longer.

=over 2

=item *

In C<CHECK_EACH_BYTE> mode, the module will wait to receive an C<ACK>
condition after every single byte of transfer. This mode is the most
technically-correct in terms of aborting the transfer as soon as the required
C<ACK> is not received, but consumes an entire USB transfer roundtrip for
every byte transferred, and is therefore the slowest.

=item *

In C<CHECK_AFTER_ADDR> mode, just the addressing command is sent and then the
first C<ACK> or C<NACK> bit is read in. At this point the module takes the
decision to abort (on C<NACK>) or continue (on C<ACK>). If it continues, it
will send or receive all the subsequent bytes of data in one go.

=item *

In C<CHECK_AT_END> mode, the entire I²C transaction is sent to the I<FDTI>
device, which will collect all the incoming C<ACK> or C<NACK> bits and any
incoming data. Once the entire transaction has taken place, the module will
check that all the required C<ACK>s were received. This mode is the fastest
and involves the fewest USB operations.

=item *

In C<CHECK_NONE> mode, the module will not check any of the C<ACK> conditions.
The entire write (or write-then-read) transaction will be sent in a single
USB transfer, and the bytes received will be returned to the caller.

=back

Because it offers a useful hybrid between speed efficiency and technical
correctness, C<CHECK_AFTER_ADDR> is the default mode.

writing, followed by the bytes given in the data, and finally a stop
condition.

Performs an I²C write operation followed by a read operation within the same
transaction to the chip at the given (7-bit) address value.

The device sends a start condition, then a command to address the chip for
writing, followed by the bytes given in the data to output, then a repeated
repeated start condition, then a command to address the chip for reading. It
then attempts to read up to the given number of bytes of input from the chip,
sending an C<ACK> condition to all but the final byte, to which it sends
C<NACK>, and then finally a stop condition.
